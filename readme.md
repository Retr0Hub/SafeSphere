🔒 What is ARMOR?
ARMOR is a women’s safety initiative with a clear vision: to create a safer world where women live independently, confidently, and without fear. It’s more than a project—it’s a mission to address daily challenges and empower women with tools and awareness to navigate safely.
Prioritizing women’s safety with cutting-edge technology, Team Armor introduced a dual-layered solution – ARMOR (a smart mobile app) and SafeSphere (a standalone gadget). ARMOR ensures real-time emergency alerts, live tracking, and evidence recording, while SafeSphere, an ESP32-based device, works without internet or smartphone connectivity, detecting fear via ECG-based automatic SOS triggers. Designed as a hidden accessory, it provides undetectable yet powerful protection, ensuring safety is always within reach. 🛡️
